# runb

Runbooks written in markdown that you can execute from the terminal.

## Backgorund

This project is *heavily* inspired by [Atuin](https://atuin.sh/)'s new desktop app
but `runb` is cli-first rather than being gui-first.

A goal of `runb` is for everything to be as close to markdown as possible. Code
blocks are runnable and configuration is stored in frontmatter and in the
[meta section](https://mdxjs.com/guides/syntax-highlighting/#syntax-highlighting-with-the-meta-field)).
